			<h2>Open-Source Only</h2>
			<p>
				To encourage openness and prevent the spread of malware and adware through devices, our app store only contains open source projects.
				All apps are reviewed by real humans after submission, and their content is verified. Benefits to developers: free resource usage analysis
				and an extra layer of error checking! Benefits to users: less worrying about the integrity of a product and more fun using it!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Do No Evil</h2>
			<p>
				Misleading apps are a bad thing, but shutting down a project because of a misunderstanding is unnecessary and stupid.
				When an app submission results in an issue, we don't just tell the developer to go away. Instead, we strive to help fix the issues we find
				in order to help projects achieve success.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Plagiarisms Beware</h2>
			<p>
				While it isn't possible to check the entirety of the internet for duplicate code, we do our best to prevent copied or unattributed apps
				from making their way onto our store. We keep documentation of all dependencies our apps use and what license they are published under to
				ensure that no issues occur.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>But At What Cost?</h2>
			<p>
				As I'm sure you can tell, we have put a lot of work into making this project a success (pro tip: promising success before it's achieved is a
				horrible method of motivation). From the backend magic to our beautiful website
				and our Android app, this project has taken months of planning and development to complete,
			  <!-- delete upon completeion --> which seems a little weird to say right now, as it hasn't been finished yet.
				And it's still not over. However, because all the
				applications on here are free, we don't think it's right for their users to pay to use them or for their developers to pay to publish them.
				That's why we intend to make all our money through donations, advertisements, and paid promotions. As the project expands, we may implement our
				own method of donating to the developers of apps we host that we take a percentage of, but that will come later. Much, much later.

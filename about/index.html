			<h1>About DDStore</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Open-Source Only</h2>
			<p>
				To prevent the spread of malware and adware through devices and to help the open source community as much as possible, this app store only contains open source projects.
				All apps are reviewed by certified "definitely real" humans after submission, and their content is verified to match the source code they provide. Benefits for developers: 
				faster & easier releases, and less restrictions on what you can and cannot publish. Benefits to users: less worrying about the security or content of a product, and more 
				time to use it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Helpful Feedback</h2>
			<p>
				As software distribution has become far more common over the past few years, the word "review" has been a topic of many arguments. While most developers see it as a way 
				for them to see how useful their products are in the eyes of their user, many users only see it as a way for people to recommend it to others and suggest whether they 
				should use it or not based on their own experience. While this may work for larger software and companies aiming to make a profit, it has no place in the world of open 
				source software, where the goal of both parties should be to make the product better, not to increase or reduce its availability in any way.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Full Anonymity</h2>
			<p>
				One of the major issues that individual developers have trouble publishing apps on larger distribution services like Google Play is that, in order to make a profit,
				they require you to provide a physical address where you can be contacted (<b>not</b> just a PO box). While larger companies can lease office space, most individuals
				are forced to provide their home address, opening them up to countless amounts of spam, just for wanting to make some pocket money from a hobby. Since we don't handle
				purchases here, there is no legal requirement for you to provide any information about yourself, other than a way for us to contact you if something goes wrong.
				Provided that you "Do No Evil", and that your project does not put us or our users at risk, we will not enforce any restrictions over the use of payments in your apps.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Do No Evil</h2>
			<p>
				Misleading apps are a bad thing, but shutting down a project because of a misunderstanding is unnecessary and stupid. While automation is a big part
				of this project, that automation does not extend to the handling of issues and policy violations. During any issue that occurs when publishing an app,
				developers will have direct contact with the person that decides whether to allow their project to be published or not, giving both the developer and the
				reviewer a clear picture of what the problem is and how it can be solved.
				<br><br>
				As time goes on, we may need to reduce the amount of reviews that we handle (this project is run by an extremely small amount of people, after all), and will take 
				necessary actions, such as banning repeat offenders and automatically removing apps we think were created by bots or spam accounts, to ensure that we (the moderators) 
				can remain available to developers when they need us. In addition, we will consider creating a service to allow select groups of users to test & review projects themselves 
				before they are published.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Plagiarisms Beware</h2>
			<p>
				While it isn't possible to check the entirety of the internet for duplicate code, we do our best to prevent copied or unattributed apps from making their way onto the 
				store. This includes keeping a thorough documentation of all dependencies that apps in our store use and what license they are published under so that we can prevent 
				licensing issues before they occur. While we do not have the ability to outsource things such as DMCA takedown requests to other companies better equipped to review them,
				we will do our best to handle them ourselves in a timely manner, as described under "Do No Evil" above.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>But At What Cost?</h2>
			<p>
				As I'm sure you can tell, we have put a lot of work into making this project a success (pro tip: promising success before it's achieved is a
				horrible method of motivation). From the backend magic to our beautiful website
				and our Android app, this project has taken months of planning and development to complete,
			    <!-- delete upon completion --> which seems a little weird to say right now, as it hasn't been finished yet.
				And it's still not over. However, because all the
				applications on here are free, we don't think it's right for their users to pay to use them or for their developers to pay to publish them.
				That's why we intend to make all our money through donations, advertisements, and paid promotions. As the project expands, we may implement our
				own method of donating to the developers of apps we host that we take a percentage of, but that will come later. Much, much later.

			<h1>FAQs</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Are we trying to compete with services like ApkMirror or F-Droid?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Short answer:</b> no.<br>
				<b>Long answer:</b> both ApkMirror and F-Droid's main focus is distributing products, not giving developers feedback. While DDStore does provide the same
				functionality, this is for ease of use only - there is no requirement for applications to be installed from DDStore in order to review them. In fact,
				several parts of DDStore are meant to complement existing distribution services, and not replace them.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>What "human support" is actually provided?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Short answer:</b> as much as we think you need.<br>
				<b>Long answer:</b> currently, the only support we provide is for issues related to the store itself - best practices, misleading interfaces, licensing issues, etc. 
				Unfortunately, we cannot help fix bugs encountered in your apps during testing, simply because we do not have enough time to do so, but there is nothing stopping
				others from helping to fix these issues instead.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Who moderates submissions for the store?</h3>
			<p>
				Initially, the only moderators of the store will be the people at <a href="https://doubledotlabs.github.io/">DDL</a> that built it. However, as the
				project gains traction, we hope to appoint some of the active community members as moderators as well.

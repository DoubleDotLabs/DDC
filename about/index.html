			<h1>About DDStore</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Open-Source Only</h2>
			<p>
				To prevent the spread of malware and adware through devices and to help the open source community as much as possible, this app store only contains open source projects.
				All apps are reviewed by certified "definitely real" humans after submission, and their content is verified to match the source code they provide. Benefits for developers: free resource usage analysis
				and an extra layer of pre-release testing! Benefits to users: less worrying about the security or content of a product and more fun using it!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Do No Evil</h2>
			<p>
				Misleading apps are a bad thing, but shutting down a project because of a misunderstanding is unnecessary and stupid.
				When an app submission results in an issue, we don't just tell the developer to go away. Instead, we strive to help fix the problems we find
				in order to help projects achieve success.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Plagiarisms Beware</h2>
			<p>
				While it isn't possible to check the entirety of the internet for duplicate code, we do our best to prevent copied or unattributed apps
				from making their way onto the store. We keep a thorough documentation of all dependencies our apps use and what license they are published under
				so that we can prevent licensing issues before they occur.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>But At What Cost?</h2>
			<p>
				As I'm sure you can tell, we have put a lot of work into making this project a success (pro tip: promising success before it's achieved is a
				horrible method of motivation). From the backend magic to our beautiful website
				and our Android app, this project has taken months of planning and development to complete,
			  <!-- delete upon completion --> which seems a little weird to say right now, as it hasn't been finished yet.
				And it's still not over. However, because all the
				applications on here are free, we don't think it's right for their users to pay to use them or for their developers to pay to publish them.
				That's why we intend to make all our money through donations, advertisements, and paid promotions. As the project expands, we may implement our
				own method of donating to the developers of apps we host that we take a percentage of, but that will come later. Much, much later.

			<h1>FAQs</h1>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Are we trying to compete with services like ApkMirror or F-Droid?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Short answer:</b> no.<br>
				<b>Long answer:</b> both ApkMirror and F-Droid's main focus is distributing products, not giving developers feedback. While DDStore does provide the same
				functionality, this is for ease of use only - there is no requirement for applications to be installed from DDStore in order to review them. In fact,
				several parts of DDStore are meant to complement existing distribution services, and not replace them.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>What "human support" is actually provided?</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, the only support we provide is for issues related to the store itself - best practices, misleading interfaces, licensing issues, etc. Unfortunately,
				we cannot help fix bugs encountered during testing, simply because we do not have enough time to do so.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Who moderates submissions for the store?</h3>
			<p>
				Initially, the only moderators of the store will be the people at <a href="https://doubledotlabs.github.io/">DDL</a> that built it. However, as the
				project gains traction, we hope to appoint some of the active community members as moderators as well.
